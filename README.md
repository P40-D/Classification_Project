# Telco Customer Churn Prediction

This project aims to predict whether a customer will churn from a fictional telco company based on various demographic and service-related features.

## Overview

The dataset consists of 7043 customers from California and includes information on their demographics, service usage, and churn status. The goal is to build a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn.

## Steps Taken

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Examined the dataset for patterns, trends, and missing values.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Addressed missing values and incorrect datatypes.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Created new features or transformed existing ones to improve model performance.
4. **Model Comparison:** Compared at least three classification models using various metrics.
5. **Model Validation:** Employed validation techniques to ensure model robustness.
6. **Final Model:** Chose the best-performing model based on evaluation metrics and used it for predictions.
